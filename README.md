#Project-E-Manager
- This project aims to create a command line program for pocket money for students to spend in a particular month. The idea is to manage your expenses on a weekly basis instead of spending heavily in the first half and then living like a pauper in the second.
- Allows the user to input a certain amount of money at the beginning of the month and then spend it according to a classification of three types of weeks (given by high-spending week, moderate-spending week and low-spending week) and spend the money without exceeding the limit as decided on each week.

## Installation
- Fork this project to your GitHub account.
- After forking, enter the following commands in your terminal.
```
$ git clone  https://github.com/user_name/E-Manager
$ cd E-Manager/src
$ g++ main.cpp
$ ./a.out
```
Next should be fairly simple to follow.

## Usage
This is primarily built to use for day-to-day usage in student life. It is very helpful at a later stage of life as well though.
